# TinyMindMutiLableClassify    
## Abstract    
For the competition of TinyMind Multi-label classification, I implement the model with three methods:     
a simple net    
vgg16 to extra the feature of image, and three fullconnection layers for classification    
ResNet50 to extra the feature of image, and three fullconnection layers for classification    
Util 9.2, I trained one epoch by the second method, and submit the valid result to TinyMind, catch the score 16.08.    
## Next    
Because of the GPU memory size is 2G, something can't be tried, so I'll keep training the Network more epoch with CPU.
